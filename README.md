The application will start, and you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`. You can use this interface to interact with the RESTful endpoints and explore the available operations.
Once the App is running you can also view `http://localhost:8080/actuator`. Monitoring our app, gathering
metrics,
and understanding traffic or the state of our database becomes trivial with this dependency used.
The actuator mainly exposes operational information about the running application â€” health, metrics, info, dump,
env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
